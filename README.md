My project was using experimental parameters from another research group to leverage a known model of potential energy at the quantum mechanical scale. I used this model to produce a 3D mapping of potential energy in a specific space within MOF-5 (an artificial crystal structure). The mapping acted as input data into a numerical Schrodinger equation solver developed by another collaborator. The output was the possible states that would give the position and energy statistical distributions of an H2 molecule in the context of the MOF-5 potential. I created visualizations of the molecule, potential mapping data, and energy states to convey the findings. The result of this work was presented to a committee of faculty as a thesis and later an in person defense of the thesis. The results were also presented in an hour long talk to a general audience.
This project was done to see if the used parameters in combination with the model was able to produce data that was comparable to that of experimental data. Much of the quantum mechanical scale simulations have complications when considered at the molecular scale due to the interdependence of the parameters. This means the calculations be done numerically with the hope of convergence and often with a variety of methods to show consistency of the result.
