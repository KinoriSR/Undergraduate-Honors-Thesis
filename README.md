2) Potential Producing code (this is also at the end of my thesis)
3) Python script used to make visualizations of MOF-5 in Paraview

My project was using another research group's parameters to produce a a 3D mapping of potential energy in a specific space within MOF-5 (an artificial crystal structure). The mapping acted as input data into a different collaborator's numerical Schrodinger equation solver. The output was the possible states that would give the positional and energy distribution of an H2 molecule in the context of the MOF-5 potential.
